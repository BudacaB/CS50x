## Arrays (C programming)

### Compilation steps

- preprocessing - imports needed code from the used libraries (header files) - e.g. stdio.h
- compiling - converts code to assembly
- assembling - converts assembly code to source code (0 and 1)
- linking - combines all the files into the final output/executable file

### Cryptography

- Scrambling info to keep it private
- Input is plain text
- Output is cyphertext
- A key is needed for decryption

In C

    - variables are passed by value (e.g. a function gets a working replica of the variable)
    - arrays are passed by references (e.g. the programs 'trusts' a function not to break the actual array)
